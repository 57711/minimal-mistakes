After graduation from undergraduate school, I attended a project for business startup hosted by the undergraduate school. The business is for the network acceleration and selling the network switches products. This project of the business startup was successful, for we sold many products. Meanwhile, I realized that in my capability I also need more academic knowledge in work. The most importantly, I really like this major, electrical engineering, and do not need to change to another field. I can study deeper in this discipline and pursue a higher degree.

During my undergraduate study, I took a lot of classes which the credit is more than needed. Because of that, I have experienced many areas in this field, including the embedded system, signal processing, EDA, and other academic areas, which helps me to develop a full knowledge framework of this discipline. What’s more, I always spend hours preparing for each class and thus I became skilled in applying computer and other modern technology for electronic information control and processing. I prefer to research electronic equipment and information system. Meanwhile, the college curriculum meets my requirement perfectly, such as Neural Network gives me the chance to contact with a mathematical model of the information processing, during which my ability to analyze and solve problems has been significantly enhanced. Additionally, the learning of programming language and microcomputer theory cultivates my rigorous thinking mode and teaches me to apply the special thinking way into other aspects, such as the ability to simplify and deposit the complex problem into several minor parts in order to save time and resource. Moreover, I have learned to analyze problems and find solutions from different perspectives with the instruction of electronic courses. I think these professional skills are really needed in graduate study.

Another practical experience that I am willing to mention is the internship in SANGFOR Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. in Shenzhen. In this period, I studied related network technology knowledge, like cyber security, network acceleration, and virtualization. What is more, I was allowed to join the development of client software on customer management for a wireless network according to my outstanding internship performance. I found more interests during this process and propose my ideas about the development. However, at the same time, I also meet many obstacles because of lacking sound professional knowledge and practical experience. Therefore, I decide to pursue a further education and explore more mysteries in this field.

Cooperation and collaboration are important skills for graduate study in this discipline. During the study in Mason, I always like to attend study group with other classmates to discuss and the topic of the class. Also, I like to share study sources to others and get help from classmates, such as sharing the open course video online and attend a group meeting in the library. What’s more, since a lot of classmates have working experiences, I can always get useful information about careers from them. Also, the professors in Mason are likely to assist students. Both the questions in the class and academic and career life can be solved through the advises given by professors and advisors.

In the future after finishing the graduate study in electrical engineering, I aspire to become a system engineer in a national company. My reason for this goal is from my experience in the business. This is a position that needs comprehensive knowledge and rich experiences, which is a work full of challenge. To achieve this goal, I will not only study the theoretical knowledge but also obtain abundant practical experience. I have participated in various college academic events and internships to promote my ability. For instance, I participated in the Electronic Science and Technology Competition in undergraduate school and won a prize for my project about network fast distribution method. Thanks to this experience, I consolidate my skills on the network protocol as well as a programming language and I feel for the first time the joy of innovation. Along with development and offering supportive services, I am would also like to focus on the state-of-the-art techniques, for the novel techniques can always be used to improve current technology application. I believe that in view of my interest and perseverance, I will get great achievement in this field in the future.
