In this section, I have listed all the courses that I have taken in the first two semesters, and the courses that I will study in degree seeking. For the graduation requirement, the degree requirements of master degree of electrical engineering are clearly:


* A minimum of two core courses should be taken, including ECE 521, ECE 528, ECE 548 and ECE 584. 
* A minimum of three courses at 600 or above should be taken as well. 
* 6 credits hours of non-ECE courses are needed. 
* To complete the degree program, a scholarly paper is required, which is ECE 797. 
* During process for each class, a grade of B or better meets the requirement. 
* Before starting the scholarly paper, 30 credits of course work and an enrollment of 600-level research project are required, as well as a scholarly paper project report and present findings.

The plan of study table is shown below.
