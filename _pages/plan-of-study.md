The Electrical Engineering is a field to study and examine the electricity, electronics as well as electromagnetism. This discipline works as a significant role in the contemporary development of science and have a close relation with daily life. Electrical engineers can design, operate, and supervise the electrical system and devices, and develop multiple consumer electronics. The subject of electrical engineering is a wide-range engineering because it contains various of sub-disciplines. The department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers 6 specializations, including Bioengineering, Communications and Networking, Signal Processing, Control and Robotics, Microelectronics, and System Architectures. For this reason, I chose this major. I think this wide-field subject can engage me in an outstanding achievement. Because this discipline still retains a lot of charm on me after I have reached a bachelor degree, I decide to study thoroughly. 
I need to take various class in future to meet the graduation requirement. The plan of study table is shown below.
Course Title and Number	Number of Credits	Semester
ECE 521 Modern Systems Theory (pre-requisite for ECE 722, ECE 620, ECE 621)	3	Fall 2016
ECE 528 Introduction to Random Processes in Electrical and Computer Engineering (pre-requisite for ECE 630, ECE 642, ECE 621)	3	Spring 2017
ECE 642 Design and Analysis of Computer Communication Networks	3	Spring 2017
ECE 620 Optimal Control Theory	3	Fall 2017
ECE 630 Statistical Communication Theory (pre-requisite for ECE 731)	3	Fall 2017
ECE 621 Systems Identification	3	Fall 2017
AIT 524 Database Management Essentials	3	Spring 2018
AIT 580 Analytics: Big Data to Information	3	Spring 2018
ECE 722 Kalman Filtering with Applications	3	Spring 2018
ECE 731 Digital Communications	3	Fall 2018
ECE 797 Scholarly Paper (Seminar)	0	Fall 2018

The degree requirements of master degree of electrical engineering are clearly. To graduate, I must finish a minimum of two core courses, including ECE 521, ECE 528, ECE548 and ECE584. A minimum of three courses at 600 or above should be taken as well. Six credits hours of non-ECE courses are needed. To complete the degree program, a scholarly paper is required, which is ECE 797. During process for each class, I must get a grade of B or better to meet the requirement. Before starting the scholarly paper, 30 credits of course work and an enrollment of 600-level research project are required, as well as a scholarly paper project report and present findings. By doing this, I can get a master degree satisfactorily.
