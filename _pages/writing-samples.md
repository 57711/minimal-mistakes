This page presents some of my writing artifacts, including the Academic Writing Analysis in project 2 of EAP 506, and other academic working. 

### Academic Writing Analysis in Electrical Engineering

The electrical engineering is a branch of engineering researching the electricity, and information technologies, which works as a significant role in current scientific development and relates closely in our daily life. At George Mason University, this discipline contains several specific areas, including bioengineering, communications, signal processing, and microelectronics.

This portfolio is a project of the course EAP 506, researching the methods and functions of academic writing in professional disciplines. Serving as a direction for international student in this field, in this portfolio, a specific area, signal processing, has been researched and examined. The conventions of academic writing in this discipline have been fully analyzed. Students can access to the experimental research and academic writing through this portfolio.

By analyzing four elements in this discipline, including professor, journal, journal article, and the language choices in an article, I discovered the rules for academic writing and assorted knowledge in this industry, which indicates a appropriate way in the research and academic writing. In the professor research, I surveyed Professor Zhi Tian, who is working at George Mason University. I determined her academic qualifications, research interests, and her published articles. In journal analysis, a prestigious nationwide professional journal, Signal Processing Magazine, has been studied, including features of this journal, and writing conventions in this field. In the third part, journal article analysis, I analyzed a research paper about Matching Theory, concerning its overall structure and rhetorical elements. At last, this portfolio summarized language choices and the formal language usage by language analysis.

### Multidisciplinary Colloquium Project 

**Introduction**

Augmented reality (AR) has been widely used in many fields, especially in cultural heritage [1], which provides people a motivation to learn history and helps to protect cultural heritage as shown in figure 1 [2]. AR facilitates the revolution of cultural heritage reconstruction and exhibition. Meanwhile, different surroundings and environment of cultural heritage promote the development of AR technique as well. Because that AR in different application and project faces different reconstruction solution, a widely-used reconstruction solution with optimal properties in the similar cultural heritage conditions. Although the growing AR utilization in cultural heritage, including Kalman filter and Particle filter, few research has generated a universal method to similar situations and no review categorized the AR method utilized in cultural heritage. Researchers always focused on one individual application and gave one specific solution. The previous AR method applied on cultural heritage reconstruction should be synthesized and classified into its fit application scenarios, which can offer a clear understanding of different AR method for researchers. Because of the tracking process or pose estimation is the central question in AR reconstruction, thus, in this poster, I will analyze and classify two main AR tracking methods, Kalman filter, and particle filter, from literature and find a recommended AR solution with desired properties in some similar applications. This review of literature can helps researchers to choose the suitable method in their projects and improve the algorithm in this field.
