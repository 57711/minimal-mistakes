Dear Human Resources:

I am applying for the position of the summer internship for summer 2017 in Electrical Engineering.


As a graduate student at George Mason University, I will complete an M.S. in electrical engineering in Aug 2018. The possibility of working at Amazon is exciting to me because of the multicultural working environment, being the top business and technical company in the world, and the innovative programs and products in Amazon, which can bring me valuable experiences.


During my undergraduate studying, I held a development internship concerning the network development and network architecture. In addition, I worked with a diverse student body that in the field of electrical engineering and had some experiences on projects. During this practicum, I developed individual abilities concerning academic usage, social development, and leadership.


Enclosed is a current resume for your consideration, which highlights my experiences and professional skills. I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you in person so we might discuss more fully the scope of the position and my qualifications for it. I can most easily be reached on my email at bsong2@gmu.edu. Thank you for your consideration and time.


Sincerely,


Botian Song
