During my pathway program, many experiences matter to my learning. All event happened in two semesters cultivate my learning skills and broaden my personal experiences. I will illustrate my reflection of pathway learning in three aspects, peers review, learning skills, and research skills. 

After one semester learning, I noticed that peers play an important role in American pedagogy. I need peer reviews every, especially for my writing work. Peers review always can indicate out my drawback or advantages in my work, which can help me to modify and improve my work. I had an assignment of the personal portfolio in the first semester. The peer review of my website is needed and necessary. From peer review of my website, I know other peoplesâ€™ views on my work and find flaws in it. Some notices have been received from people. They noticed me to concentrate the architecture of articles and to pay attention to the format on the website. This advice was helpful and valuable to assist me to get a comfortable grade in the end, for I may not notice such details on my own. Thus, I will keep this procedure in my future learning. 

Since the requirement need to take both major and EAP classes, it was very busy for a whole semester. I have to treat with dues every week for homework from major and writing assignments from EAP. Because of this experience, however, it promotes me to manage my time efficiently and reasonably, which practice my time management skill and learning efficiencies. As we know, it is always overloaded during the end of a semester. Things happened on me. I have experienced to finish three major materials and assignments in only one week in the first semester, which need a stunning working capability to treat with. In my experience, the library is the first-chose-place that makes me concentrate on my work and improve effectiveness. 

For now, one of the systematic projects I made is the Multidisciplinary Colloquium Project in EAP class this semester. I required doing a review of the literature concerning in my discipline in the whole semester. I experienced a completed research procedure in the MCP, from raising questions, find exigence and research purpose, to carry out a well-accomplished article and a poster. In this project, I not only finished a project but also learned a specific procedure of how to do a research, which works a tremendous effect on my professional and research skills. I may use these methods I learned to keep doing research in my future research in my discipline.
