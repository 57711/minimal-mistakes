# Introduction

I am Botian Song, an INTO mason student studying in the Standard Pathway Program in Masters&#39;s degree of Electrical Engineering at George Mason University. 

The Electrical Engineering is a field to study and examine the electricity, electronics as well as electromagnetism. This discipline works as a significant role in the contemporary development of science and have a close relation with daily life. Electrical engineers can design, operate, and supervise the electrical system and devices, and develop multiple consumer electronics. Because this discipline still retains a lot of charm on me after I have reached a bachelor degree and this wide-field subject can engage me in an outstanding achievement, I chose this major and decide to study thoroughly. 

This portfolio describes my achievements in the Pathway Program of Electrical Engineering by presenting the Academic and Professional Products, Progression Requirements, and Pathway Reflection. I believe this portfolio depicts my academic progress in the Pathway Program.
