# Introduction

I am Botian Song, an INTO mason student studying in the Standard Pathway Program in Masters&#39;s degree of Electrical Engineering at George Mason University. This portfolio describes my achievements in the Pathway Program by using the Academic and Professional Products, Progression Requirements, and Pathway Reflection. I believe this portfolio depicts my academic progress in the Pathway Program.
